Several alterations have been made as the new pandas version no longer supports the .append() method. Thus, I used .concate() instead.
The graphs for TSLA and GME (q5,6) â€“ somehow not visible when I try to upload the notebook to GitHub - are attached as screenshots instead. They were visible in my screen
and through the practice run sessions.

Thank you for peer marking my work. Have a great day!
